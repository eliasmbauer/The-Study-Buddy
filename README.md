# Study-Buddy-the-open-source-digital-assignment-planner-and-digital-pet-device

Welcome to Study Buddy! This project is an open-source combination of a digital assignment planner and a digital pet device designed to make productivity fun and engaging.

Simply follow the schematic and flash the provided code to use the Study Buddy

Notice: This project is a work in progress, as of right now it is functional but there are some aspects of it missing, like missing pet frames and a proper assembly guide

# Limited functionality; if this project gains enough support or turns out to actually be desired by people, then there are also a lot of features I want to bring to it in the future such as:
- Different types of pets
- Pet names 
- More pet emotions and statistics 
- A pet house
- Pet minigames
- Designing a custom PCB for this project
